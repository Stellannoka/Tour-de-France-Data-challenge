# Tour-de-France-Data-challenge
This is a succinct overview of the illustrious Tour de France competition from 1903 to 2022.

Tour de France is one of the largest sports events in the world. The three weeks cycling race attracts 10 to 15 million (non-paying) spectators along the roads each year and individual stages are watched by 15 to 20 million TV viewers worldwide.

The objective of the project: Create an infographic-styled visual that will inform new viewers about the competition and heighten interest in the 2023 edition of the Tour de France.
A wide-ranging and thorough understanding can be gleaned from the historical dataset offered, but for this project, I have chosen to concentrate on the fundamentals of the event, winning statistics, and what to anticipate from this year's edition of the race.
The following tasks were completed for this project using Power BI:
-Cleaning and manipulation of data
-Created calculation-based columns and measurements
-Performed data modeling.
The insights are clearly shown in the infographic visual below:
